The main reason for setting up the frontend build in Maven is for production deployment and CI/CD purposes. Let me explain the pros and cons of both approaches:
### Using VSCode for Frontend Development
**Pros:**
- Better development experience for Angular
- Faster hot-reload during development
- Better TypeScript support and Angular-specific extensions
- More familiar environment for frontend developers
- Direct access to Angular CLI commands
- Easier debugging of frontend code

**Cons:**
- Separate process from backend
- Need to run backend and frontend separately

### Using Maven Frontend Plugin
**Pros:**
- Single deployment artifact (frontend gets packaged inside the Spring Boot JAR)
- Automated builds in CI/CD pipelines
- Ensures consistent builds across environments
- Works well with Docker builds (as in your case with `jib-maven-plugin`)
- No need to install Node.js/npm on production servers

**Cons:**
- Slower development cycle
- Less ideal for frontend development
- More complex setup

### Best Practice Approach
You can actually use both:
1. **For Development:**
    - Use VSCode for frontend development
